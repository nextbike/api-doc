# api-doc
official Nextbike API documentation

This Repo includes our [Maps OpenAPI spec](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextbike/api-doc/master/maps/nextbike-maps.openapi.yaml) of our proprietary availibility feed that you can directly [view online](https://mrin9.github.io/OpenAPI-Viewer/#/load/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fnextbike%2Fapi-doc%2Fmaster%2Fmaps%2Fnextbike-maps.openapi.yaml).

You also find us in the [GBFS API](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/systems.csv) to use a more standards compliant availibility feed.
